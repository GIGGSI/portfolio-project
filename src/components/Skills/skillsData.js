                Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
                Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
               Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data

            `CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser. 
           The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to display them properly. 
           A style declaration contains the properties and their values, which determine how a webpage looks.
           CSS is one of the three core Web technologies, along with HTML and JavaScript. 
           CSS usually styles HTML elements, but can be also used with other markup languages like SVG or XML.`
